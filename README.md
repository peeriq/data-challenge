# PeerIQ Data Challenge

## Background
PeerIQ is growing and we are seeking exceptional candidates to build out our data operations team! We have created this test as an alternative to traditional coding challenges. We believe that artificial problems with no connection to our subject matter given under artificial conditions (no internet access, unrealistic time constraints) aren't useful in evaluating candidates. Instead, we've created this test to let you show off your problem solving skills!

The test is designed to give us a lot of information we need to know about you!

## Requirements
Jupyter Notebook and Microsoft Excel

## Python Challenge
Go to resources folder and download:
 * lc_raw_data.zip
 * PeerIQ.Python.Data.Analyst.Challenge.ipnyb
 
Save both files in your local machine. Open up the jupyter notebook and follow further instructions in that file. 


## Excel and SQL Challenge
Go to resources folder and download PeerIQ.Excel.Data.Analyst.Challenge.xlsx.

Save the file in your local machine. Open up the workbook and follow further instructions in the file.


## Submission
Save both files with your solutions in the following format:
* `<FirstName>.<LastName>-PeerIQ.Python.Data.Analyst.Challenge.ipnyb`
* `<FirstName>.<LastName>-PeerIQ.Excel.Data.Analyst.Challenge.xlsx`
